# Social Proof : UseInfluence to Dhain Se oh धाएं से and then proof.ai

### What is social proof?

We as human take pride in validation, like the clothes we wear or the car we drive, we want others to know and follow what we did or at least repeat the same. Following the herd or crowd where you end
up buying a product or giving in as a lead is social proof.

According to the principle of social proof, one way that individuals determine appropriate behavior for themselves in a situation is to examine the behavior of others there, especially similar to others . As a consequence, people tend to behave as their friends and peers have behaved.
